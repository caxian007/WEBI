Our Planet, Earth

This is our planet, Earth.
It is one of eight planets that travl around our sun. Earth is the only planet where lift exists.
It is the third planet from the sun.
Mercury is the closest planet to the sun.
The second closet planet to the sun is Venus.
Our planet is 93 million miles from the sun.
The sun gives us the anergy that we need.
The sun is very inportant to us all.
It give us heat and light.
Without it, there would be no lift on Earth.
If we were closer to the sun, it would be too hot for us. Our planet would burn.
If we were father to the sun, it would be too clod for us. Our planet would freeze.
As you can see, the balance in nature is very important.
In nature, small changes can make big differences.

Air, Water and Pollution

Besides energy from the sun, we also need water and air.
Without water and air, there would be no life.
Without enough water, there aren't enough plants and trees.
Plants and trees produce the air that we breathe.
We also need water to grow our food.
In some parts of our world, there isn't enough water.
Without enough water, food can't grow and people don't have enough to eat.
Conditions must be right for lift exist.
When confitions are not right, lift cannot exist.
For example, millions of years ago there were forms of lift that no longer exist.
They died out because conditions changed.
Now all of us face the problem of pollution.
Pollution changes the conditions that we depend on.
Polluted air makes us sick. It's bad for our heath.
Polluted air also kills the plants which give us clean air.
Polluted water kills animals and fish. It also poisons our food supply.
Automobiles are a major cause of air pollution.
Clear air and clean water. We need them both to live our lives.
The mountains, the rivers, the forests, and all of nature are a part of us.
This beautiful planet of ours is our home.
To take care of the world is to take care of ourselves.
Let's work together to keep our world alive and well.
