# Planning Ahead

```markdown
Departure

Next week Max is going on a business trip.
He's going to fly to London from San Francisco.
He tried to buy airplane tickets last week. but the flight was full.
Yesterday his travel angent called and told him there was space on the flight.
Max is going to get the ticket in the mail tomorrow.
He's going to take British Airways beacuse it has a non-stop flight.
It takes about ten hours to fly from San Francisco to London.
If he leaves on Saturday afternoon, he'll arrive in London on Sunday morning.
Max is going to arrive in London on a Sunday.
The next day, on Monday, he's going to attend a metting.
However, he'll probably be very tired.
The time difference between London and San Francisco is eight hours.
That means when it's late at night in London, it's afternoon in San Francisco.
As a result, it's often hard to sleep in the hotel at night.
Max will probably watch a late movie on TV before he goes to bed.
If he still can't sleep, he may telephone his wife and childran in San Francisco.
It's always nice to travel and see the world, but Max misses his family.
Whenever he is always from home, he looks forward to comming back.
As the saying goes: There's no place like home.

Choices

When he lands in London, he'll claim his baggage and go through customs.
Then he'll have to decide how to get to his hotel.
One way to get from airport to his hotel is to go by taxi.
But the taxi fare is expensive.
It's cheaper to go by bus or subway.
In London, the subway system is called the Underground.
Max isn't sure what he will do.
If he's tried, he may dicide to take a taxi.
On the other hand, he may decide to take a bus.
If he decides to take a bus or a taxi, he can see the contryside.
Once he arrives at his hotel, he'll check in.
Hotels are expensive in London, but weekend rates are a bit less.
Sometimes it's possible to get a cheaper rate if you stay for several days.
Max has a good travel agent, so he's going to get a 20% discount.
