## Tongue Twister:
Mom does a lot, let’s go for a jog. 
Let’s go get the dog, or we could shop with pop. 
Maybe we will hop. We’ll hop on top, on top of the dog. 
Mom wants us to mop, I told her to stop. 
The mop I did drop, so mom called the cop. 

## 浊化：
1. /s/ 后面的清辅音要浊化。 如：
/k/浊化成/g/: scar/school/discussion
/t/浊化成/d/: stand/student/mistake
/p/浊化成/b/: spring/spirit/expression
2. 美音中，当/t/出现在两个元音之间并且处于非重读位置的时候，/t/需要浊化成一个近似于/d/的音。这样，writer听起来和rider 的发音几乎没有区别。
如：
Letter/water/better/duty/bitter/city
I got it.
Would you please pick it up?
注：/t/如果处于重读位置的话，即使在两个元音之间也不需要浊化。请比较：
清晰的/t/	浊化的/t/
I'talian	'Italy
a'tomic	'atom
La'tino	'Latin
pho'tographer	'photograph
