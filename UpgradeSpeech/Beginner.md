Hello everyone, and get to know the weather.

Since entering the 39th days, the cold air has begun to slack off, leading to an increase in fog and haze in areas such as North China and Huanghuai. Today is the worst day of visibility in the near future. The visibility of these deep red areas on the map is generally less than 500 meters.

From this evening to tomorrow morning, there will still be heavy fog or thick fog from Tianjin to the north part of Hunan. Among them, the visibility of the southwest part of Shandong, the east part of Henan, the north and south parts of Anhui, and the central part of Hubei is less than 200 meters, and some areas have even strong fog with visibility less than 50 meters.

In the daytime tomorrow, the fog in some places will turn into a haze, but in the middle of north China, the impact of weak cold air will be weakened tomorrow. And the southerly position needs to wait until the arrival of the relatively strong cold air of the day after tomorrow, then the fog and haze will gradually weaken and dissipate from north to south.

The cost of re-emergence of the blue sky is to cool down. Tomorrow, the northeast region will generally cool down by 2-6 degrees. The day after tomorrow, there will be a stronger cooling from the west to the east.

For example, the highest temperature in Shenyang today is 4 degrees, which is 9 degrees higher than the average maximum temperature in the same period of the year. This can be said to be a rare warmth in 39th days. But the maximum temperature is only negative seven degrees next Tuesday. On the next Monday and next Tuesday, temperatures in most parts of the north, including Shenyang, will fall back to the normal  level, or even slightly lower.

Come to pay attention to precipitation. From this evening to tomorrow, Jiangnan and south China still have a wide range of rainy days. In addition, there will be large blizzards in parts of west Tibet. 

Let's take a look at the specific city weather forecast.

Note: 39th days refers to the third "9 days" from the winter solstice, which is the 19th to 27th days after the winter solstice.
